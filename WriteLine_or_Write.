console.Writeline will print a message to the program for example:
Console.WriteLine("Jack");
"Jack" will be shown In the console window; but If you have multiple Console.WriteLine will go down instead of across each word, e.g:

Console.WriteLine("Jack");
Console.WriteLine("Jack");
Console.WriteLine("Jack");

This will show Jack
               Jack
               Jack
But what If you wanted It to go across on the same line Instead of going down? The solution/technique Is Console.Write; this print words on the same line e.g:

Console.Write("Jack");
Console.Write("Jack");
Console.Write("Jack");

This will show Jackv Jack Jack

Or you can just write the whole sentence In one Console.WriteLine but there Is always two options!
